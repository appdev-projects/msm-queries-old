## Objective

In this project, we'll practice using `.where` and other ActiveRecord query methods. (It would be good to have [the ActiveRecord Chapter](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/770#where) open in a tab for easy reference.) We're going to practice in the context of our familiar movie-related domain â€”Â Directors, Movies, Characters, and Actors. If you still have the printed-out paper tables from Day 1, it's very helpful to have it out to look at.
