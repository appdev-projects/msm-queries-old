Okay! Now that we have some data to play around with, let's practice answering some queries in `rails console`.

### Finding a movie by title

In what year was the movie `"The Dark Knight"` released?

 - Use the [`.where` method](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/770#where). It is everything.
 - Remember that [`.where` always returns a collection, not a single row](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/770#where-always-returns-a-collection-not-a-single-row).
